#Testing Lecture Live Code

Use Test-Driven-Development to solve the following challenges


1. Multiples of 3 and 5
=======================

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


2. Write a class Dog
====================

Initialize dog with attributes
* age
* breed
* name
* gender
* spayed_or_neutered
* cost_to_adopt
* owner_name

Write the following methods:

* in_shelter?
* bark
* adopt!(owner_name)
  * Sets owner_name
  * changes spayed_or_neutered to true
  * changes cost_to_adopt to nil
  * raises an error if owner_name is missing or empty string
